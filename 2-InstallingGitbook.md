##Getting Started

Go to your terminal (I highly recommend [Cmder Emulater for Windows][1]), and 

	npm install gitbook-cli -g

This will install command like tools for gitbook. Next do 

	gitbook versions

to check if the gitbook if already installed it or not. To install gitbook 

	gitbook versions:install latest

To check the version of gitbook do 

	gitbook versions:print

To check all the available versions of gitbook do 

	gitbook versions:available

To check all the versions of gitbook installed in your system do 

	gitbook versions

###And you are up and running!
