# Gitbook POC

**Gitbook** is a Node.js Framework for developing and writing books or write documentations using [Markdown](http://help.gitbook.com/format/markdown.html "Github Markdown Help Tutorial"). It generates a complete interactive static website (like this one) with routes implemented. This is the README.md file that you can read, along with all the code necessary to build the gitbook that you are reading, on [gitbook-poc][1] repository.
